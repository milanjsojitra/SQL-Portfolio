## Dataset Details  

This dataset was from the [Layoffs Dataset](https://github.com/swaptr/layoffs-dataset) by swaptr.  
It entails the tech layoffs starting from **March 11, 2020** (when COVID-19 was declared as a pandemic), to present, **June 1, 2024**.

## Project Overview  

I prepared the [raw dataset](https://github.com/swaptr/layoffs-dataset) through standard cleaning processes, and analyzed the resulting data to identify trends and create insights from it.  
My main goal was to understand the impact of COVID-19 and the distribution of layoffs across the tech industry.
